pinbored-webkit
===============

Pinbored native OSX client built with Node-webkit and AngularJS. Future plans include windows / linux
builds as well, but for now focus is on OSX (using NUWK! instead of CLI node-webkit magic for development simplification). See https://github.com/michahell/pinbored for more info of history of this project.

Roadmap V2
----------

* tag management screen
* stale check all bookmarks

for bookmark creation consider using Shiori: http://aki-null.net/shiori/ or another bookmarking app.
i could add this functionality, but it's mainly aimed at **managing** one's bookmarks.
