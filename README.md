Pinbored native OSX client built with Node-webkit and AngularJS. Future plans include windows / linux
builds as well, but for now focus is on OSX (using NUWK! instead of CLI node-webkit magic for development simplification). See https://github.com/michahell/pinbored for more info of history of this project.

Why
===

Why use a separate bookmark service to manage bookmarks? I have < insert browser > for that?

* Access bookmarks across multiple browsers.
* Independant of browser crashes, sudden loss of all bookmarks, malware.
* Being sure that no google, mozilla or microsoft are using your bookmarks for whatever.

There are several apps that already do this but they are either commercial software or did not have the simple features that i want them to have.

For bookmark creation consider using:

* Shiori: http://aki-null.net/shiori/ or just: ```brew cask install shiori```
* browser dependant plugins or widgets.

i could add bookmark creation functionality in a later version, however this was never the intention of this app.
The app is aimed at **managing** one's bookmarks, for example after a switch from < insert browser >
to Pinboard with some 1000 unmanageable bookmarks.

Building
========

On OSX, somehow the number of max-open files is by default 256. This is too little to build this project,
so one must set it to allow more. ```ulimit -S -n 4096``` allows 4096 files to be open, i have found this is
enough. This is because right now, the whole node_modules and bower_components folders are zipped into application bundles, which contain huge amounts of (unused) files.

steps
-----

1. clone project somewhere
2. run ```npm install``` (installs dev. and app dependancies and bower components)
3. run ```grunt test``` (tests everything and shows jasmine report in google chrome)
1. run ```grunt build``` (for ALL application bundles) OR
2. run
    * ```grunt osx``` (for OSX application bundle)
    * ```grunt win``` (for Windows application bundle)
    * ```grunt lin32``` (for Linux 32 bits application bundle)
    * ```grunt lin64``` (for Linux 64 bits application bundle)

npm test isn't used since the same gruntfile is used for Travis, which cannot build node-webkit headlessly (yet).
